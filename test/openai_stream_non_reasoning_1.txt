The image is a small UI snippet with two Chinese items and radio-style circles:

- “任务队列” (Task queue)
- “错误提示” (Error prompt / Error message)

The “file” content you pasted is Python code using `client.chat.completions.create(..., stream=True, stream_options={"include_usage": True})` and an error trace showing:

- `IndexError: list index out of range` at `chunk.choices[0]`

It’s explaining that some streamed chunks can have `choices == []` (especially when `include_usage` is enabled), so you must check `if not chunk.choices: continue` before accessing `choices[0]`, and then check `delta.content` before printing.The image is a small UI snippet with two Chinese items and radio-style circles:
